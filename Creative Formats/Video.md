# Recommended Video Formats
## As at 12/20/2019
## Note:
- If possible, shoot in a higher quality than what you plan to export.
- Framerate should be set at the video's native frame rate, higher frame rate is usually more realistic (especially in action scenes)

### Overview
Use native files whenever possible.

May wish to consider transcoding if the performance is not up to snuff. 

May want to consider proxies if the file is huge.

When distributing the file, use the YouTube settings
